## 🚀 Overview

Grading oral exams in real-time is stressful. You have to listen, ask questions, calculating deductions, and writing down scores—all at once. 

**Oral Test Marking System** solves this by providing a grid-based interface where you can:
*   **Deduct marks instantly** using custom hotkeys (e.g., Press `Q` for -2 marks).
*   **Navigate entirely via keyboard** (Enter/Tab/Arrows).
*   **Auto-calculate totals** seamlessly.
*   **Export results** to professional PDF reports or CSV.

## ✨ Features

*   **⚡ Speed-Focused UI**: Minimal mouse usage. Navigate and mark at the speed of thought.
*   **🎹 Custom Hotkeys**: Map keys to specific deductions (e.g., `G` = Grammar Error -2).
*   **📊 Dynamic Sections**: Configure your own test structure (Reading, Speaking, etc.).
*   **🛡️ Data Safety**: Auto-saves to local storage after every keystroke.
*   **📄 Export Ready**: Generate clean PDF reports or raw CSV data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **HTML5 / CSS3** (Grid & Flexbox)
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (No frameworks, no build steps)
*   **html2pdf.js** (For PDF generation)
